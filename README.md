# Battleship-Game
Battleship game for 2 players in console.

Technology: C++

Project which I did as an assingment on Warsaw Universtiy of Technology. 
Players can choose number of ships, name them and put them on the map. Then they can play like a normal battleship game.

To use this project locally, upload all of the files to your new visual studio project.
